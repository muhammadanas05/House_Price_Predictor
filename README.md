# Real Estate Price Predictor

This project aims to predict the prices of real estate properties based on various features such as the number of rooms, zoning classification, and socio-economic status of the neighborhood. The prediction is done using machine learning techniques, primarily regression models.

## Data Loading and Exploration

The dataset used in this project contains information about real estate properties. Initially, the data is loaded and explored to understand its structure and contents. Key steps include:

- Importing necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
- Reading the dataset from a CSV file.
- Exploring basic information about the dataset including data types and summary statistics.
- Visualizing the distribution of certain variables through histograms and scatter plots.

## Train-Test Splitting

Before proceeding with model training, the dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately. Various methods such as simple random sampling and stratified sampling are employed to ensure representative splits.

## Feature Engineering and Preprocessing

Feature engineering techniques are applied to derive new features and preprocess the data for model training. This includes:

- Identifying and analyzing correlations between features and the target variable.
- Handling missing values using techniques like imputation.
- Scaling numerical features to a standard range using techniques like Min-Max scaling and Standardization.

## Model Selection and Training

Several regression models are considered for predicting real estate prices, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression. The models are trained using the preprocessed data, and their performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Model Evaluation and Deployment

The trained models are evaluated using cross-validation to ensure robustness and reliability. The best-performing model is selected based on its performance metrics. Finally, the chosen model is saved for future use and tested on unseen data to assess its real-world performance.

## Usage

Once trained and tested, the saved model can be easily loaded and used to predict real estate prices for new data samples. This allows users to obtain accurate price estimates for properties based on their features.
